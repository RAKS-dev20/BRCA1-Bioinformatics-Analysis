# BRCA1-Bioinformatics-Analysis

## Description
This is a bioinformatics mini-project focused on the **BRCA1 gene**. The project includes steps for **sequence retrieval, protein annotation, BLAST analysis, gene structure, and genome visualization** using various bioinformatics databases and tools such as **NCBI, UniProt, EMBL, DDBJ, BLAST, and UCSC Genome Browser**.

The goal is to explore and analyze the BRCA1 gene at both the **DNA and protein levels** and generate meaningful visualizations and insights.

## Project Objectives
- Retrieve BRCA1 gene and protein sequences from **NCBI, EMBL, and DDBJ**.
- Perform **protein annotation** using **UniProt**.
- Conduct **BLAST analysis** to find homologous sequences.
- Analyze the **gene structure**, including exons, introns, and regulatory regions.
- Visualize the **genomic location** and structure of BRCA1 using **UCSC Genome Browser**.
